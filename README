This is a Python library which provides the ability to interact with various
Valve services and products, including:
 * The Steam web API
 * Locally isntalled Steam clients
 * Source dedicated server querying
 * Source master server querying
 * A Valve Data Format (.vdf) parser and serialiser

... and prehaps more in the future.

Currently this project is undergoing significant reworking in order to make
it viable for use outside its original intended use case. This work will
including better documentation and testing, as well as most/all components
being rewritten.
